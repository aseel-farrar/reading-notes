# Read: 27 - Intents, Activities, and SharedPreferences

## Tasks:

- It is a collection of metadata and information around a stack of activities.
- The activities are arranged in a stack—the back stack—in the order in which each activity is opened.
- "last in, first out" stack
- startActivity():pushing a new activity onto your task causing stop or pause the previous activity if exists.
- finish():it pops the stack,removing activity from the back stack and moving to the previous stak.

## Managing Tasks

- It uses for:

  - begin a new task when it is started (instead of being placed within the current task).
  - start an activity, you want to bring forward an existing instance of it (instead of creating a new instance on top of the back stack)
  - you want your back stack to be cleared of all activities except for the root activity when the user leaves the task.
    tartActivity()`.

In this regard, the principal `<activity>` **_attributes_** you can use are:

1. taskAffinity
2. launchMode
3. allowTaskReparenting
4. clearTaskOnLaunch
5. alwaysRetainTaskState
6. finishOnTaskLaunch

And the principal intent **_flags_** you can use are:

1. FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK
2. FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP
3. FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP

### Defining launch modes

Launch modes allow you to define how a new instance of an activity is associated with the current task. You can define different launch modes in two ways:

1. Using the manifest file
2. Using Intent flags

As such, if Activity A starts Activity B, Activity B can define in its manifest how it should associate with the current task (if at all) and Activity A can also request how Activity B should associate with current task. If _both_ activities define how Activity B should associate with a task, t**_hen Activity A's request (as defined in the intent) is honored over Activity B's request (as defined in its manifest)._**

> Note: Some launch modes available for the manifest file are not available as flags for an intent and, likewise, some launch modes available as flags for an intent cannot be defined in the manifest.

- _Using the manifest file_

When declaring an activity in your manifest file, you can specify how the activity should associate with a task using the `<activity> `element's launchMode attribute.

The launchMode attribute specifies an instruction on how the activity should be launched into a task. There are `four` different launch modes you can assign to the launchMode attribute:

1. "standard" (the default mode)
2. "singleTop"
3. "singleTask"
4. "singleInstance"

## Starting a task

You can set up an activity as the entry point for a task by giving it an intent filter with "android.intent.action.MAIN" as the specified action and "android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" as the specified category. For example:

```xml
<activity ... >
    <intent-filter ... >
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
    ...
</activity>
```

## Save key-value data

If you have a relatively small collection of key-values that you'd like to save, you should use the `SharedPreferences` APIs. A `SharedPreferences` object points to a file containing key-value pairs and provides simple methods to read and write them. Each `SharedPreferences` file is managed by the framework and can be private or shared.

### Get a handle to shared preferences

You can create a new shared preference file or access an existing one by calling one of these methods:

1. `getSharedPreferences()`

2. `getPreferences()`

### Write to shared preferences

To write to a shared preferences file, create a `SharedPreferences.Editor` by calling `edit()` on your `SharedPreferences`.

Pass the keys and values you want to write with methods such as `putInt()` and `putString()`. Then call `apply()` or `commit()` to save the changes. For example:

```java
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getActivity().getPreferences(Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPref.edit();
editor.putInt(getString(R.string.saved_high_score_key), newHighScore);
editor.apply();

```

`apply()` changes the in-memory `SharedPreferences` object immediately but writes the updates to disk asynchronously. Alternatively, you can use `commit()` to write the data to disk synchronously. But because `commit()` is synchronous, you should avoid calling it from your main thread because it could pause your UI rendering.

### Read from shared preferences

To retrieve values from a shared preferences file, call methods such as `getInt()` and `getString()`, providing the key for the value you want, and optionally a default value to return if the key isn't present. For example:

```java
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getActivity().getPreferences(Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
int defaultValue = getResources().getInteger(R.integer.saved_high_score_default_key);
int highScore = sharedPref.getInt(getString(R.string.saved_high_score_key), defaultValue);
```
