# Read: 28 - RecyclerView

## Create dynamic lists with RecyclerView

- It is a container for displaying large datasets which can be scrolled efficiently by maintaining limited number of views.
- It is more flexible and advanced version of GridView and ListView.
- RecyclerView reuses the view for new items that have scrolled onscreen.

## Key classes

- Several different classes work together to build your dynamic list.

`RecyclerView` is the ViewGroup that contains the views corresponding to your data. It's a view itself, so you add `RecyclerView` into your layout the way you would add any other UI element.

Each individual element in the list is defined by a view holder object. When the view holder is created, it doesn't have any data associated with it. After the view holder is created, the `RecyclerView` binds it to its data. You define the view holder by extending `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`.

The RecyclerView requests those views, and binds the views to their data, by calling methods in the adapter. You define the adapter by extending `RecyclerView.Adapter.`

The layout manager arranges the individual elements in your list. You can use one of the layout managers provided by the RecyclerView library, or you can define your own. Layout managers are all based on the library's `LayoutManager` abstract class.

### Steps for implementing your RecyclerView

If you're going to use RecyclerView, there are a few things you need to do:

1. First of all, decide what the list or grid is going to look like. Ordinarily you'll be able to use one of the RecyclerView library's standard layout managers.

2. Design how each element in the list is going to look and behave. Based on this design, extend the ViewHolder class. Your version of ViewHolder provides all the functionality for your list items. Your view holder is a wrapper around a View, and that view is managed by RecyclerView.

3. Define the Adapter that associates your data with the ViewHolder views.

## Plan your layout

- The items in RecyclerView are arranged by a LayoutManager class.
- The RecyclerView library provides three layout managers.

1. LinearLayoutManager arranges the items in a one-dimensional list.
2. GridLayoutManager arranges all items in a two-dimensional grid (Vertically and Horizantaly)
3. StaggeredGridLayoutManager: it does not require that items in a row have the same height or items in the same column have the same width.

- **_Implementing your adapter and view holder:_**
  - When you define your adapter, you need to override three key methods:
    - `onCreateViewHolder()`
    - `onBindViewHolder()`
    - `getItemCount()`
