# Read: 08 - OO Design

## SOLID: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design:

- SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin _(also known as Uncle Bob)_.
- SOLID is a structured design approach that ensures your software is modular and easy to maintain, understand, debug, and refactor.

## SOLID stands for:

      - *S* -> Single-responsiblity Principle
      - *O* -> Open-closed Principle
      - *L* -> Liskov Substitution Principle
      - *I* -> Interface Segregation Principle
      - *D* -> Dependency Inversion Principle

## 1) Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP):

    * A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

## 2) Open-Closed Principle:

- Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.

## 3) Liskov Substitution Principle:

    * Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T. This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

## 4) Interface Segregation Principle:

    * A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## 5) Dependency Inversion Principle:

    * Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
