# Android Fundementlals

- Android apps can be written by kptlin,java or c++.
- Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix.
- APK file contains all the contents of an Android app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.

## App components: essential building blocks of an Android app.

- Activities:the entry point for interacting with the user.It represents a single screen with a user interface.
- Services:A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons.
- Broadcast receivers:is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements.
- Content providers:set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access.

## Intent

- An intent is created with an Intent object, which defines a message to activate either a specific component (explicit intent) or a specific type of component (implicit intent).
- For activities and services, an intent defines the action to perform.
- For broadcast receivers, the intent simply defines the announcement being broadcast.

## There are separate methods for activating each type of component:

- You can start an activity or give it something new to do by passing an Intent to startActivity() or startActivityForResult() (when you want the activity to return a result).
- With Android 5.0 (API level 21) and later, you can use the JobScheduler class to schedule actions. For earlier Android versions, you can start a service (or give new instructions to an ongoing service) by passing an Intent to startService(). You can bind to the service by passing an Intent to bindService().
- You can initiate a broadcast by passing an Intent to methods such as sendBroadcast(), sendOrderedBroadcast(), or sendStickyBroadcast().
- You can perform a query to a content provider by calling query() on a ContentResolver.

## The manifest file

- app must declare all its components in AndroidManifest.xml file, which must be at the root of the app project directory.

## Declaring components:

  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

  <manifest ... >
  <application android:icon="@drawable/app_icon.png" ... >
  <activity android:name="com.example.project.ExampleActivity"
  android:label="@string/example_label" ... >
  </activity>
  ...
  </application>
  </manifest>
  ```

- In the `<application>` element, the android:icon attribute points to resources for an icon that identifies the app.
- In the `<activity>` element, the android:name attribute specifies the fully qualified class name of the Activity subclass and the android:label attribute specifies a string to use as the user-visible label for the activity.

## Declaring app requirements

- it uses to prevent your app from being installed on devices that lack features needed by your app
- android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
  ...
  minSdkVersion 26
  targetSdkVersion 29
  }
  }
