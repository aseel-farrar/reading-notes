# Read: 03 - Flexbox and Templating

## ***Flexbox***

* This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

* Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.

1. **`justify-content`**: aligns items *horizontally* and accepts the following values:

* `flex-start`: Items align to the left side of the container.
* `flex-end`: Items align to the right side of the container.
* `enter`: Items align at the center of the container.
* `space-between`: Items display with equal spacing between them.
* `space-around`: Items display with equal spacing around them.

```css
.container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;
}
```

2. **`flex-direction`**: establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.

* `row` (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
* `row-reverse`: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
* `column`: same as row but top to bottom
* `column-reverse`: same as row-reverse but bottom to top

```css
.container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}
```

3. **`align-items`**: defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line.

* `stretch` (default): stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)
* `flex-start` / `start` / `self-start`: items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the flex-direction rules or the writing-mode rules.
* `flex-end` / `end` / `self-end`: items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about respecting flex-direction rules vs. writing-mode rules.
* `center`: items are centered in the cross-axis
* `baseline`: items are aligned such as their baselines align

```css
.container {
  align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline | last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end + ... safe | unsafe;
}
```
