# Read: 16 - Spring Authentication

## Authentication and Access Control

- Spring Security has an architecture that is designed to separate authentication from authorization and has strategies and extension points for both.
- The main strategy interface for authentication is AuthenticationManager, which has only one method:

```java
public interface AuthenticationManager {

  Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication)
    throws AuthenticationException;
}
```

An `AuthenticationManager` can do one of 3 things in its `authenticate()` method:

- Return an `Authentication` (normally with `authenticated=true`) if it can verify that the input represents a valid principal.

- Throw an `AuthenticationException` if it believes that the input represents an invalid principal.

- Return `null` if it cannot decide.

## Spring Auth Cheat Sheet

### Step 1: set up a user model and repo

### Step 2: create a controller for that model

### Step 3: UserDetailsServiceImpl implements UserDetailsService

- gets a User from the database by username (make sure your repository has the method to make this easy!)

### Step 4: ApplicationUser implements UserDetails

- use IntelliJ to implement the methods; make the boolean ones all return true

### Step 5: WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

- has a UserDetailsService
- passwordEncoder bean
- configure AuthManagerBuilder
- configure HttpSecurity
  - cors? csrf?
  - matchers for URLs that are allowed
    - ensure that login and signup URLs allowed; also consider homepage etc.
  - formLogin with login page set up
  - logout

### Step 6: registration page

- create it w/ form
- ensure it posts to a route your controller is ready for
- check it's saving in the DB

### Step 7: login page

- create it w/ form
- ensure it posts to the route you specified in web config
- try it out!
- add to a template w/ things about the Principal
