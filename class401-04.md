# Read: 04 - OOP

## Objects

- A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods.
- Through these object interactions, a program can carry out various tasks, such as implementing a GUI, running an animation, or sending and receiving information over a network.
- Once an object has completed the work for which it was created, its resources are recycled for use by other objects.

### Creating Objects

- As you know, a class provides the blueprint for objects; you create an object from a class.
- Each of the following statements taken from the CreateObjectDemo program creates an object and assigns it to a variable:

```java

Point originOne = new Point(23, 94);
Rectangle rectOne = new Rectangle(originOne, 100, 200);
Rectangle rectTwo = new Rectangle(50, 100);
```

- The first line creates an object of the Point class, and the second and third lines each create an object of the Rectangle class.

- Each of these statements has three parts (discussed in detail below):

**Declaration**: The code set in bold are all variable declarations that associate a variable name with an object type.
**Instantiation**: The `new` keyword is a Java operator that creates the object.
**Initialization**: The `new` operator is followed by a call to a constructor, which initializes the new object.

### Bundling code into individual software pros of using to build code

- Modularity
- Information-hiding
- Code re-use
- Pluggability and debugging ease

## Classes:

### Declaring Classes:

- The preceding class declaration is a minimal one. It contains only those components of a class declaration that are required.

  ```java

  class MyClass {
      // field, constructor, and
      // method declarations
  }

  ```

- You can provide more information about the class, such as the name of its superclass, whether it implements any interfaces, and so on, at the start of the class declaration. For example,

  ```java

  class MyClass extends MySuperClass implements YourInterface {
      // field, constructor, and
      // method declarations
  }
  ```

- class declarations can include these components, in order:

1. Modifiers such as public, private, and a number of others that you will encounter later.
2. The class name, with the initial letter **_capitalized_** by convention.
3. The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
4. A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
5. The class body, surrounded by braces, {}.

### Overloading Methods

- The Java programming language supports overloading methods, and Java can distinguish between methods with different method signatures
- This means that methods within a class can have the same name if they have different parameter lists.

### Providing Constructors for Your Classes

- A class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects from the class blueprint. Constructor declarations look like method declarationsâ€”except that they use the name of the class and have no return type. For example, Bicycle has one constructor:

```java

public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
    gear = startGear;
    cadence = startCadence;
    speed = startSpeed;
}
```

### Returning a Class or Interface

- If this section confuses you, skip it and return to it after you have finished the lesson on interfaces and inheritance.

- When a method uses a class name as its return type, such as whosFastest does, the class of the type of the returned object must be either a subclass of, or the exact class of, the return type.
