# Read: 05 - Heroku Deployment

## On Windows

- Download and run the installer for your platform:
- start the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or Powershell to access the command shell.
- Use the heroku login command to log in to the Heroku CLI.
- click the Log in button displayed on the page, This authentication is required for both the heroku and git commands to work correctly.
- this will work for any version of Node greater than 10 - check that itâ€™s there: check it by type`$ node --version` in terminal.
- To clone a local version of the sample application that you can then deploy to Heroku, execute the following commands in your local command shell or terminal:

## Deploy the app

- create an app, a git remote (called `heroku`) is also created and associated with your local git repository.
- Now deploy your code: `$git push heroku main`.
- Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running: `$heroku ps:scale web=1`
- open the website as follows: `$heroku open`

## View logs

- View information about your running app using one of the logging commands, `heroku logs --tail`, Press `Control+C` to stop streaming the logs.

## Define a Procfile

This declares a single process type, `web`, and the command needed to run it. The name web is important here. It declares that this process type will be attached to the HTTP routing stack of Heroku, and receive `web` traffic when deployed. This command will use the `start` script that is specified in the `package.json`.

## Declare app dependencies

Heroku recognizes an app as Node.js by the existence of a `package.json` file in the root directory. For your own apps, you can create one by running `npm init --yes`.

## Run the app locally

tart your application locally using the `heroku local` command
