- CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces.
- display: Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.
  - `grid`: generates a block-level grid
  - `inline-grid`: generates an inline-level grid
- `grid-template-columns` & `grid-template-rows`: Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.

```css
.container {
  .container {
    grid-template-columns: 40px 50px auto 50px 40px;
    grid-template-rows: 25% 100px auto;
  }
}
```

- `grid-template-areas`: Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the grid-area property. Repeating the name of a grid area causes the content to span those cells. A period signifies an empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of the structure of the grid.
  Values:
  - `<grid-area-name>`: the name of a grid area specified with grid-area
  - `.`: a period signifies an empty grid cell
  - `none`: no grid areas are defined

```css
.item-a {
  grid-area: header;
}
.item-b {
  grid-area: main;
}
.item-c {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
.item-d {
  grid-area: footer;
}

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header header"
    "main main . sidebar"
    "footer footer footer footer";
}
```

- `column-gap` & `row-gap` & `grid-column-gap` &`grid-row-gap`: Specifies the size of the grid lines. You can think of it like setting the width of the gutters between the columns/rows.
