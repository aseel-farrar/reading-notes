# Read: 15 - Diversity and Inclusion

* ***When Women Stopped Coding?***

  * Modern computer science is dominated by men. But it hasn't always been this way.

  * A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women. And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.

  * The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

* ***Why diversity matters to your tech company?***
  * Those that are new to diversity and inclusion often are unsure how to approach it — how to talk about the subject internally and externally, how to rank it among competing priorities and how to allocate appropriate resources. Before answering these questions, it’s helpful to identify why diversity and inclusion matters to you and your company specifically.

  * Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

* ***  Here are five themes that have emerged from those conversations:***
    * Diverse teams are smarter and more creative
    * Diverse companies perform better

    * Companies are losing out on great talent

    * Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base

    * It’s the right thing to do
