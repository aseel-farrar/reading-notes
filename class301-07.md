## **What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team**

- Our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of.

* Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.

- In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.

* Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. In a 2015 study, executives said that profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more. Within companies and conglomerates, as well as in government agencies and schools, teams are now the fundamental unit of organization.

- Project Aristotle’s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? Or did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards?

* Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google: How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals. They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.

## SuperAgent

SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!

```javascript
request
  .post("/api/pet")
  .send({ name: "Manny", species: "cat" })
  .set("X-API-Key", "foobar")
  .set("Accept", "application/json")
  .then((res) => {
    alert("yay got " + JSON.stringify(res.body));
  });
```

### Test documentation

The following test documentation was generated with Mocha's "doc" reporter, and directly reflects the test suite. This provides an additional source of documentation.

**_Request basics_**
A `request` can be initiated by invoking the appropriate method on the request object, then calling `.then()` (or `.end()` or `await`) to send the request. For example a simple GET request:

```javascript
request
  .get("/search")
  .then((res) => {
    // res.body, res.headers, res.status
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // err.message, err.response
  });
```

HTTP method may also be passed as a string:

```javascript
request("GET", "/search").then(success, failure);
```

**_Setting header fields_**
Setting header fields is simple, invoke `.set()` with a field name and value:

```javascript
request
  .get("/search")
  .set("API-Key", "foobar")
  .set("Accept", "application/json")
  .then(callback);
```

You may also pass an object to set several fields in a single call:

```javascript
request
  .get("/search")
  .set({ "API-Key": "foobar", Accept: "application/json" })
  .then(callback);
```

**_GET requests_**
The `.query()` method accepts objects, which when used with the GET method will form a query-string. The following will produce the path `/search?query=Manny&range=1..5&order=desc`.

```javascript
request
  .get("/search")
  .query({ query: "Manny" })
  .query({ range: "1..5" })
  .query({ order: "desc" })
  .then((res) => {});
```

**_HEAD requests_**
You can also use the `.query()` method for HEAD requests. The following will produce the path `/users?email=joe@smith.com`.

```javascript
request
  .head("/users")
  .query({ email: "joe@smith.com" })
  .then((res) => {});
```

**_CORS_**
For security reasons, browsers will block cross-origin requests unless the server opts-in using CORS headers. Browsers will also make extra OPTIONS requests to check what HTTP headers and methods are allowed by the server.

The `.withCredentials()` method enables the ability to send cookies from the origin, however only when `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is not a wildcard ("\*"), and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is "true".

```javascript
request
  .get("https://api.example.com:4001/")
  .withCredentials()
  .then((res) => {
    assert.equal(200, res.status);
    assert.equal("tobi", res.text);
  });
```
