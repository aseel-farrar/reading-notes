# Read: 06 - Node, Express, and APIs

## What Is Node.js?

- Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

- Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

- Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript: this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues

## What Is Node.js Used For?

- Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server
- it can be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC
- It can also be used to write your own command line tool, such as this Yeoman-Style generator to scaffold out new projects
- can be used to build cross-platform desktop apps and even to create your own robots

## The Node.js Execution Model

- Node.js, is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.
- Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.
- Node.js even has a built-in module to help you implement a cloning strategy on a single server.

## Are There Any Downsides?

- Node runs in a single thread does impose some limitations, blocking I/O calls should be avoided, CPU-intensive operations should be handed off to a worker thread, and errors should always be handled correctly for fear of crashing the entire process.

## What Kind of Apps Is Node.js Suited To?

- Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration
- Node is good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven

## What Are the Advantages of Node.js?

- Aside from speed and scalability
- Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB).
- JavaScript is ubiquitous: most of us are familiar with JavaScript, or have used it at some point. This means that transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages
