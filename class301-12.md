## EJS Partials

* Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.
* Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you don’t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.
* In EJS, any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by `<% %>` delimiters
* The `<% - %>` tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like `<,>,` etc…
* Including a partial in EJS is quite straightforward. You use `<%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>` where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.

## What are Observables?

* Observables are similar to promises but with major differences that make them better.

* Observables are a new primitive coming with ES7 (ES2016) that helps handle asynchronous actions and events.
