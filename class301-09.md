## Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

- Functional programming concepts like immutability and pure function. Those concepts are big advantages to build side-effect-free functions, so it is easier to maintain systems — with some other benefits.
- Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

### Pure functions

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).
- It does not cause any observable side effects.

### Pure functions benefits

- The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything.
- So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
  - Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B.
  - Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D.

## Immutability

- When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

## Referential transparency

```sql
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
```

### Functions as first-class entities:

- The idea of functions as first-class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data.
  Functions as first-class entities can: - refer to it from constants and variables. - pass it as a parameter to other functions.
- return it as result from other functions.

### Higher-order functions:

- When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either: takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result.
