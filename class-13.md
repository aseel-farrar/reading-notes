# Read: 13 - Local Storage

## Local Storage

### HTML5 Storage:
 * is a specification named Web Storage which is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs *locally*.
 * you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string.
 * data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.

```javascript
interface Storage {
  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);
  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);
};
```

 * Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server.
 * it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.

* From your JavaScript code, youâ€™ll access HTML5 Storage through the localStorage object on the global window object. Before you can use it, you should detect whether the browser supports it. you can use Modernizr to detect support for HTML5 Storage.

```javascript
if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}
```
