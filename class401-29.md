# Read: 29 - Room

## Save data in a local database using Room

- The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

### benefits of room

- Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
- Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
- Streamlined database migration paths.

## Primary components

There are three major components in Room:

- The `database` class that holds the database and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to your app's persisted data.
- `Data entities` that represent tables in your app's database.
- `Data access objects (DAOs)` that provide methods that your app can use to query, update, insert, and delete data in the database.

## Defining data using Room entities

You define each Room entity as a class that is annotated with @Entity. A Room entity includes fields for each column in the corresponding table in the database, including one or more columns that comprise the primary key.

## Define relationships between objects

- A one-to-one relationship between two entities is a relationship where each instance of the parent entity corresponds to exactly one instance of the child entity, and vice-versa.
- A one-to-many relationship between two entities is a relationship where each instance of the parent entity corresponds to zero or more instances of the child entity.
- A many-to-many relationship between two entities is a relationship where each instance of the parent entity corresponds to zero or more instances of the child entity, and vice-versa.

## Accessing data using Room DAOs

- you interact with the stored data by defining data access objects, or DAOs.
- Each DAO includes methods that offer abstract access to app's database.
- At compile time, Room automatically generates implementations of the DAOs that you define.
