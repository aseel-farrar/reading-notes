## AWS Amplify

- It is a set of tools and services that can be used together or on their own, to help front-end web and mobile developers build scalable full stack applications
- With Amplify, user can configure app backends and connect app in minutes, deploy static web apps in a few clicks, and easily manage app content outside the AWS console.

## API (GRAPHQL)

- GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
- It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API.
- It gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more,
- It enables powerful developer tools.

## Add relationships between types:

> # `@connection`

- The `@connection` directive enables you to specify relationships between @model types. Currently, this supports one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one relationships.
- You may implement many-to-many relationships using two one-to-many connections and a joining @model type.

## Usage

Relationships between types are specified by annotating fields on an `@model` object type with the `@connection` directive.

The fields argument can be provided and indicates which fields can be queried by to get connected objects. The `keyName` argument can optionally be used to specify the name of secondary index (an index that was set up using `@key`) that should be queried from the other type in the relationship.

When specifying a `keyName`, the fields argument should be provided to indicate which field(s) will be used to get connected objects. If `keyName` is not provided, then `@connection` queries the target tableâ€™s primary index.

## Relations:

- Has one
- Has many
- Belongs to
- Many-to-many connections

## Limit

- The default number of nested objects is 100. You can override this behavior by setting the limit argument.

## Generates

In order to keep connection queries fast and efficient, the GraphQL transform manages global secondary indexes (GSIs) on the generated tables on your behalf when using @connection
