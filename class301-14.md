# Read: 14a - DB Normalization

## Database Normalization

- is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.

* **_Reasons for Database Normalization_**

  - There are three main reasons to normalize a database. The first is to minimize duplicate data, the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues, and the third is to simplify queries.

* **_Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies_**

  - Notice that for each SalesPerson we have listed both the SalesOffice and OfficeNumber. There are duplicate salesperson data. Duplicated information presents two problems:
    1. It increases storage and decrease performance.
    2. It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.

* **_Search and Sort Issues_**

* The last reason we’ll consider is making it easier to search and sort your data.

* **_Definition of Database Normalization_**

  - There are three normal forms most databases adhere to using. As tables satisfy each successive database normalization form, they become less prone to database modification anomalies and more focused toward a sole purpose or topic.

    - _First Normal Form_ – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
    - _Second Normal Form_ – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
    - _Third Normal Form_ – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
