## The method attribute

     The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the `GET` method and the `POST` method.

* #### **_The `GET` method_**

  * The `GET` method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.

* #### **_The `POST` method_**

  * The `POST` method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

#### Viewing HTTP requests

* The form data will be shown as follows in the Chrome Network tab. After submitting the form:

  1. Open the developer tools.
  1. Select "Network"
  1. Select "All"
  1. Select "foo.com" in the "Name" tab
  1. Select "Headers"

## On the server side: retrieving the data

* Whichever HTTP method you choose, the server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs. The way you access this list depends on the development platform you use and on any specific frameworks you may be using with it.
