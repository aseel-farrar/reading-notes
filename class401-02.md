## Packages and Import

- It is like a group which it used to group related classes and we use the Packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code.
- The first statement must be the package declaration.

- Types of Packages

  - Built-in
  - User-defined

- Common imports
  - `import java.awt.\*;` Common GUI elements.
  - `import java.awt.event.\*;` The most common GUI event listeners.
  - `import javax.swing.\*;` More common GUI elements. Note "javax".
  - `import java.util.\*;` Data structures (Collections), time, Scanner, etc classes.
  - `import java.io.\*;` Input-output classes.
  - `import java.text.\*;` Some formatting classes.
  - `import java.util.regex.\*;` Regular expression classes.

## Loop Statements


- The while Statements

  ```
  while (true){
      // your code goes here
  }
  ```

- The do-while Statements

  ```
  do {
      statement(s)
  } while (expression);

  ```

- The for Statement

  ```
  for(int i=1; i<11; i++){
      System.out.println("Count is: " + i);
  }
  ```
