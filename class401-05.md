# Read: Linked Lists

- A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.
- The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.
- There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly.

## Terminology:

1. Linked List
2. Singly
3. Doubly
4. Node
5. Next
6. Head
7. Current

## Types of Linked List:

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

## complexity:

- time: O(n) (worse case) the node which has the value that searches for it is last

- space: O(1) This because there is no additional space being used

## what makes arrays and linked lists different?:

### Memory management

- arrays: are **static data structures.**
- linked lists: are **dynamic data structures.**
- The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines.
- When an array is created, it needs a certain amount of memory(all in one place ). On the other hand, when a linked list is born, it doesnâ€™t need bytes of memory all in one place. One byte could live somewhere, while the next byte could be stored in another place in memory altogether!
