# Read: 17 - Spring Authorization

>## Authorization:

- Authorization happens after a user’s identity has been successfully authenticated.
- It is about offering full or partial access rights to resources like database, funds, and other critical information to get the job done.

>## Popular authorization techniques:

- `Role-based access controls (RBAC)` can be implemented for system-to-system and user-to-system privilege management.
- `JSON web token (JWT)` is an open standard for securely transmitting data between parties, and users are authorized using a public/private key pair.
- `SAML` is a standard Single Sign-On format (SSO) where authentication information is exchanged through XML documents that are digitally signed.
- `OpenID` authorization verifies user identity based on an authorization server’s authentication.
- `OAuth` allows the API to authenticate and access the requested system or resource.

>## There are several samples building on each other, adding new features at each step:

- ***simple***: a very basic static app with just a home page and unconditional login via Spring Boot’s OAuth 2.0 configuration properties (if you visit the home page, you will be automatically redirected to GitHub).
- ***click***: adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.
- ***logout***: adds a logout link as well for authenticated users.
- ***two-providers***: adds a second login provider so the user can choose on the home page which one to use.
- ***custom-error***: adds an error message for unauthenticated users, and a custom authentication based on GitHub’s API.
