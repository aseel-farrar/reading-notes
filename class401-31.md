# Read: 31 - Espresso

>## Espresso basics

- Use Espresso to write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests.
- It lets you create UI tests for your app without writing any test code.
- Espresso Test Recorder writes tests based on the Espresso Testing framework, an API in AndroidX Test.

>## API components

The main components of Espresso include the following:

- **Espresso**
- **ViewMatchers**
- **ViewActions**
- **ViewAssertions**

>## How it works?

### 1. Record UI interactions:

To start recording a test with Espresso Test Recorder, proceed as follows:

- Click `Run` > Record Espresso Test.
- In the Select Deployment Target window, choose the device on which you want to record the test.
- Espresso Test Recorder triggers a build of your project, and the app must install and launch before Espresso Test Recorder allows you to interact with it. The Record Your Test window appears after the app launches, and since you have not interacted with the device yet, the main panel reads "No events recorded yet." Interact with your device to start logging events such as "tap" and "type" actions.

### 2. Add assertions to verify UI elements

Assertions verify the existence or contents of a View element through three main types:

- text is: Checks the text content of the selected View element
- exists: Checks that the View element is present in the current View hierarchy visible on the screen
- does not exist: Checks that the View element is not present in the current View hierarchy

**_To add an assertion to your test, proceed as follows:_**

1. Click Add Assertion. A Screen Capture dialog appears while Espresso gets the UI hierarchy and other information about the current app state. The dialog closes automatically once Espresso has captured the screenshot.
2. A layout of the current screen appears in a panel on the right of the Record Your Test window. To select a View element on which to create an assertion, click on the element in the screenshot or use the first drop-down menu in the Edit assertion box at the bottom of the window. The selected View object is highlighted in a red box.
3. Select the assertion you want to use from the second drop-down menu in the Edit assertion box. Espresso populates the menu with valid assertions for the selected View element.
   - If you choose the "text is" assertion, Espresso automatically inserts the text currently inside the selected View element. You can edit the text to match your desired assertion using the text field in the Edit assertion box.
4. Click Save and Add Another to create another assertion or click Save Assertion to close the assertion panels.

### 3. Save a recording

- Once you finish interacting with your app and adding assertions, use the following steps to save your recording and generate the Espresso test:

1. Click Complete Recording. The Pick a test class name for your test window appears.
2. Espresso Test Recorder gives your test a unique name within its package based on the name of the launched activity. Use the Test class name text field if you want to change the suggested name. Click Save.
   - If you have not added the Espresso dependencies to your app, a Missing Espresso dependencies dialog appears when you try to save your test. Click Yes to automatically add the dependencies to your build.gradle file.
3. The file automatically opens after Espresso Test Recorder generates it, and Android Studio shows the test class as selected in the Project window of the IDE.
   - Where the test saves depends on the location of your instrumentation test root, as well as the package name of the launched activity. For example, tests for the Notes testing app save in the src > androidTest > java > com.example.username.appname folder of the app module on which you recorded the test.
