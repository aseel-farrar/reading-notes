# Read: 06 - Inheritance and Interfaces

## Inheritance

- explains how classes inherit state and behavior from their superclasses, and explains how to derive one class from another using the simple syntax provided by the Java programming language

- Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.

- In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses.

## What You Can Do in a Subclass

- A subclass inherits all of the public and protected members of its parent, no matter what package the subclass is in. If the subclass is in the same package as its parent, it also inherits the package-private members of the parent. You can use the inherited members as is, replace them, hide them, or supplement them with new members:

  - The inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields.
  - You can declare a field in the subclass with the same name as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it (not recommended).
  - You can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
  - The inherited methods can be used directly as they are.
  - You can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it.
  - You can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.
  - You can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
  - You can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super.

## Private Members in a Superclass

- A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. However, if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, these can also be used by the subclass.

- A nested class has access to all the private members of its enclosing class—both fields and methods. Therefore, a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to all of the private members of the superclass.

## Modifiers

- The access specifier for an overriding method can allow more, but not less, access than the overridden method.
- For example, a protected instance method in the superclass can be made public, but not private, in the subclass.

- You will get a compile-time error if you attempt to change an instance method in the superclass to a static method in the subclass, and vice versa.

# What Is a Package?

- A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Conceptually you can think of packages as being similar to different folders on your computer.

- The Java platform provides an enormous class library (a set of packages) suitable for use in your own applications.
- This library is known as the "Application Programming Interface", or `"API"` for short.
- Its packages represent the tasks most commonly associated with general-purpose programming.

## Interfaces



- Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide.
- Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler.
- If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods defined by that interface must appear in its source code before the class will successfully compile.
- In the Java programming language, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
- Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods.
- Interfaces cannot be instantiated—they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
- An interface can extend other interfaces, just as a class subclass or extend another class. However, whereas a class can extend only one other class, an interface can extend any number of interfaces.
- The interface declaration includes a comma-separated list of all the interfaces that it extends.
- If you define a reference variable whose type is an interface, any object you assign to it must be an instance of a class that implements the interface.

    ```java
    interface Bicycle {

        //  wheel revolutions per minute
        void changeCadence(int newValue);

        void changeGear(int newValue);

        void speedUp(int increment);

        void applyBrakes(int decrement);
    }
    ```
